            <h3>Saluda River</h3>
            <blockquote>The Lower Saluda flows from the bottom of the Lake Murray dam. We offer float trips for Rainbow
                and Brown Trout most of the year. They average ten to fourteen inches but there is always a chance to
                catch a holdover breaking the twenty inch mark, with twenty-three to twenty-eight inch fish being more
                common than you would think. From late May to early September, a large population of stripers summer in
                the river after a long migration from Santee Cooper. The concentration of fish is one of the largest
                populations of striped bass on the east coast during this time. Stripers up to forty pounds can be had
                in the summer months but most average ten to twenty pounds. We will also be offering live bait trips for
                stripers for those that are not interested in using flies and artificials lures.</blockquote>
